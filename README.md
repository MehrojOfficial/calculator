# CALCULATOR | PYTHON 

This calculator program is a simple but perfect program created using the ******tkinter*** library*** of the **Python programming language.**


## Design

This program has a convenient and compact user interface. It consists of a few **Buttons** and an **Entry** which displays the result.

## Features

This program consists of two parts (**SFF** and **DFF**). 

 1. **SFF mode**
 
**SFF mode** only supports easy and short mathematical expressions. SFF mode is simple and only for short expressions. It supports **4 mathematical operations** (plus, minus, multiply, divide) and additional two availabilities *root* and *square root*.

 2. **DFF mode**

**DFF mode** is more perfectly structured. Can solve both complex and long mathematical expressions. **DFF mode**, like *SFF mode*, supports 4 mathematical operations, root and square root. But it is also possible to solve complex expressions in *parentheses* using **DFF mode** (this option is not supported by other many calculator programs).

## Hotkeys

 - **Ctrl + X** - Switch to DFF mode
 - **Ctrl + Z** - Switch to SFF mode
 - **BackSpace** - Delete last symbol of the Entry display
 - **Delete** - Full clear Entry display
 - **Escape** - Exit the program
